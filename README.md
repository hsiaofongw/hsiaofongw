# Hi there.

## Status

- I'm currently working on my blog and my thesis;
- I'm currently learning front-end development and machine learning;

## My Blog

is separately implemented in serveral distributed packages and mostly hosted on Vercel, what mostly noticeable among them are:

- [blog-ng-nextjs](https://github.com/hsiaofongw/blog-ng-nextjs), the front-end, the index page and the directory pages;
- [blog-data-nextjs](https://github.com/hsiaofongw/blog-data-nextjs), the Content Management System (CMS) built by myself, it mainly serves JSON and some of my uploaded PDF files.
- [markdown-blog](https://github.com/hsiaofongw/markdown-blog), hosting my Markdown files, rendering my Markdown files to HTML (or ReactElement(s) more precisely).

Above packages, and other packages that my blog is consisted of, are basicly based on Next.js, React, and TypeScript.

I also built my Email service in forms of RESTful API, which together with another telemetry service that I build for monitoring my blog services status, cooperated to serve as the telemetry section of my blog system.

There is also a comment subsystem in my blog, it is based on Next.js (front-end) and Nest.js and MongoDB (back-end), due to its matureless, I do not make it public yet.

Honestly speaking, I am feelling satisfied from doing what I am doing, i.e. building my blog, since it is driven by code, or more precisely speaking: it it driven by TypeScript Code, that means the behaviour(s) of my blog system can be clearly describe in (TypeScript) code(s). Simply put, it looks like a goldfish bowl.

## What I am learning

- TypeScript, MongoDB, React, Nest.js, Next.js. I belived that someday I will be capable of bulding amazing things from those technologies.

- Recommendation system, Recurrent Neural Network. For my thesis.
