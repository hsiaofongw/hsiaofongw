# Hi there.

## Status

- I'm currently working on my blog and my thesis;
- I'm currently learning front-end development and machine learning;

## My Blog

is separately implemented in serveral distributed packages and mostly hosted on Vercel, what mostly noticeable among them are:

- [blog-ng-nextjs](https://github.com/hsiaofongw/blog-ng-nextjs), the front-end, the index page and the directory pages;
- [blog-data-nextjs](https://github.com/hsiaofongw/blog-data-nextjs), the Content Management System (CMS) built by myself, it mainly serves JSON and some of my uploaded PDF files.
- [markdown-blog](https://github.com/hsiaofongw/markdown-blog), hosting my Markdown files, rendering them into ReactElements before there is a request.

Above packages, and other packages that my blog is consisted of, are basicly based on Next.js, React, and TypeScript.

I also built my Email service serving RESTful API, togethered with another telemetry service that I build for monitoring services availibility.

There is also a comment service in my blog, which is based on Next.js (front-end), Nest.js and MongoDB (back-end), due to that it is still lack of maturity, I choose not to make it open.

I feel good from what I am doing, i.e. building my blog part by part, since all of its subsystems are written in TypeScript, so that the behaviours of the whole system can be clearly model. 

## What I am learning

- TypeScript, MongoDB, React, Nest.js, Next.js. I belived that someday I will be capable of bulding amazing things from those technologies.

- Recommendation system, Recurrent Neural Network. For my thesis.

## What I will doing

Just implement rest parts that is said to be necessary or important for a properly functional and intact blog system.

What I choose to do it myself but not by just pick the matured solutions like hugo, hexo, wordpress? Because by do it myself, the things I build are at least clear to me, the internal mechanism of every subsystem is visible and understandable to all. A programmable, scalable, flexible, resilient and clearly structural blog system is appealing to me. I will keep working on building every part and every sub-system that it should consist.
